## Project-One

### Bugs

* The session may fail to be set when logging in to Google Chrome, using incognito mode fixes that.
* The Arquillian integration testing may break if run multiple times in quick succession in the same infrastructure. (This does not happen ofter, and has yet to happen with the testing script).

### Limitations
* The CRUD operations for the user entity are not implemented.
